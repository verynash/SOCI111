                <h2 id="Functionalist">Functionalist Perspective</h2>
                <h4><i>Functionalism - the theory that various social institutions and processes in society exist to serve some important (or necessary) function the keep society running (Conley, 2021)</i></h4>
                <p>The functionalist viewpoint treats developments in society as an evolution based on what is necessary. Governments are created to keep order, businesses to supply products, and education to train people in their roles. It is useful to think of a human body as an analogy. The brain controls everything; that is the government. How does the body move and work? It uses its muscles. The muscles are the different industries, evolved to best suit their purpose. The brain needs to communicate to the body, and the body to other parts of itself. In this way, mass communication is the nervous system of society. These parts are all necessary and must work together for society to function properly. </p>
                <p>The viewpoint of functionalism also treats many other factors as necessary. For example, IQ tests help place people into jobs where they are best suited. Crime is beneficial to society because it reinforces the morals of the government and ostracizes those who go against the grain, ironically helping maintain order. Social inequality is a method of ensuring the best-suited people end up in positions of power and authority. Many of these ideas have become controversial, and as a result, conflict theory emerged in the mid-20th century. </p>

                <h2 id="Conflict">Conflict Perspective</h2>
                <h4><i>Conflict theory â€“ the idea that conflict between competing interests is the basic, animating force of social change and society in general (Conley, 2021)</i></h4>
                <p>In conflict theory, conflict is the animating force in society. It is the argument of competition over consensus, at all levels of society. Whereas functionalism explains that society evolves over time, small steps at a time, conflict theory states that it is only through revolution that large social changes occur. People are at odds with each other and compete for better schooling, work, and power. It is through the competition for these benefits that society has formed in the way that it has. </p>
                <p>Regarding social issues such as inequality, conflict theory proposes that it is due to opposing groups battling for political power. Whether in a true revolution or a modern vote, the result is that some groups are given fewer resources as a result. It is often those groups that are already in the minority that have the least power to vote or change their circumstances. It is those same groups that tend to be further strained as changes occur. In this way, there is a repeated cycle of marginalization of minority groups such as the lower class and ethnic minority groups. </p>
