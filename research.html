        <h2>The experiment method</h2>
            <p>In sociology, there are many methods of attaining information. Interviews get direct information from a related source. Surveys collect information from a larger group, allowing one to find trends in a population. Case studies allow you to observe a group to find trends in a more personal fashion. Qualitative and quantitative research are resources for gathering information in many fields. Possibly the most valuable method, though, is the experiment method.</p>
            <p>An experiment is used to find a cause-and-effect relationship. Two or more groups are set up, with at least one group as a control group. The control group is used as the basis for what is expected. In the experimental group(s), a variable is changed to measure the change in another variable. The variable that is changed is the independent variable, and the variable that is changing is the dependent variable. In the best-case scenario, there will only be a single independent variable, and all conditions aside from the independent variable will be identical. For example, to measure the effect of different foods on a species of plant, you would place multiple seeds in the same soil, under the same light conditions, with the same temperature, etc. The only thing that would change would be the type of food used for each plant, which would be the independent variable. After a few days or weeks, the height of the plants would be measured (the dependent variable) and a cause-effect relationship between food and height can be ascertained. In a science lab, it is far easier to eliminate extraneous variables; that is, it is easier to control all conditions other than the desired independent and dependent variables. When experimenting in sociology, there are often far too many extraneous variables to find an exact cause-effect relationship. Oftentimes a correlation is found, and theories for the cause and effect are created. Reproducing a sociological experiment can help narrow the possible causes for certain outcomes, but there is rarely a situation in which an exact cause-effect relationship can be determined. </p>
            <p>Here is an example of a sociological experiment on delayed gratification and its effect on future success. Start with a group of five-year-old children. The group should be sufficiently large to negate the effect of outliers on the results. Each child is going to be sat alone in a room with a treat on the table in front of them, for example, a chocolate chip cookie. The experimenter tells the child that if the cookie is on the table in fifteen minutes, the child will receive another cookie. The experimenter then leaves the room and returns in fifteen minutes. If the child has not eaten the cookie when the experimenter returns, another cookie is given, and that child is determined able to delay gratification. If the cookie has been eaten, that child cannot delay gratification. The ability to delay gratification is the independent variable. The dependent variable is a measurement of success. A good measurement could be high school grades, college attendance, or SAT scores. We will use SAT scores as there are too many variables that affect attendance of higher education institutions, and grades can vary heavily based on the school curriculum. The SAT is a standard nationwide that should be a good measure of a childâ€™s skills. </p>
            <p>The experimenters should have a hypothesis describing what they believe will happen. A good hypothesis in this situation would be that those children who can delay gratification are more likely to have higher SAT scores. Once the data has been compiled, the experimenters can prove their hypothesis to be correct or incorrect, within a certain degree of measurement. They will then be able to prove a correlation, if one exists, between delayed gratification and success. It is important to remember that numerous extraneous variables can affect the experiment's outcome. Is the test group sufficiently large? Is the test group sufficiently diverse? Is there a large difference between the median and mean of the data? Extremely high- or low-achieving students can pull the mean in one direction, in which case the median is a better predictor. All of these variables, and others, can significantly change the validity of the data, but a well-defined experiment will be the best predictor of a cause and effect.</p>
