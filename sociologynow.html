                <p>Tragedy struck in Ecuador on August 9th when presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio was shot and killed at a political rally in Quito, the country’s capital. Villavicencio was a vocal critic of organized crime and corruption. Seemingly a hit by a large cartel, six suspects were arrested at the scene. One more suspect was killed in a shootout with local authorities. Two months later, on October 6th, the six suspects were killed in a penitentiary in Guayaquil. The investigation is still ongoing. The sitting president at the time, Guillermo Lasso, swore to get to the bottom of the situation, promising “neither complicity nor cover-up” in their investigation.</p>
                <p>This is a clear example of <strong>social deviance</strong>. Social deviance consists of a wide range of societal transgressions, from things as small as nose-picking to acts as serious as murder, as in this case. The extreme that occurred in Ecuador can be considered formal deviance, better known as crime. Across society, humans have and always will strive to protect their way of life. For the gang members suspected of assassinating Villavicencio, their way of life is funded by crime. They are constantly in a state of danger when trying to provide for their families because the things they do to support them are heinous in the eyes of society. Drug trade, bribery, robbery, murder, all these acts go against the grain. Because they are so detrimental, they have been classified as crimes and have serious punishments legally. One suspect was killed because he continued to pose a threat to the public after police arrived. The other six suspects were imprisoned for their suspected actions. It is unknown who murdered those suspects in prison, but it is likely that the crime organization that put together the assassination also killed the suspects to ensure they could not be caught. </p>
                <p>Another concept that relates to this story is the <strong>culture of poverty</strong>. <a id="world-bank-link" href="https://databankfiles.worldbank.org/public/ddpext_download/poverty/33EF03BB-9722-4AE2-ABC7-AA2972D68AFE/Global_POVEQ_ECU.pdf"  target="_blank">According to a World Bank report</a>, 24.2% of Ecuador’s population lives on under $3.6 U.S. per day. There is a massive amount of poverty in that country, and it is well known that people in poverty resort to different means than middle- and upper-class people. This includes living in a home with multiple generations of family, having multiple separate families under one roof, swapping, and engaging in illegal work. The latter is a large component of crime organizations’ success in Ecuador. To feed their families, impoverished people become entangled in illegal work and the organizations that fund them. Unfortunately, that is not a situation easily exited. </p>
                <p>Once a person enters a gang or crime organization, they are both indebted to the group and in danger for possessing knowledge of its internal workings. If that person tries to leave the organization and return to a legal, more socially acceptable means of living, they could be killed to protect the organization. They also may have accepted money or other benefits in advance, leaving them in a situation where they owe their services for a longer period than initially expected. This is one way that crime organizations grow. Relating to the articles posted above, the six suspects who were murdered in prison were likely killed because of the knowledge they had. Because they were caught and were subject to legal scrutiny, it was much safer for the crime organizations to kill them than to let them speak before a jury.</p>
