                <h2 id="Durkheim">Émile Durkheim, the Father of Sociology</h2>
                <p>Émile Durkheim was born April 15, 1858, in Épinal, France. He was disciplined and intelligent, graduating from the Lycée Louis le Grand and studying at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, France. Initially studying science and social science, he found a love of philosophy and centered his attention there. He became a teacher and then a professor and taught psychology throughout France. He spent much of his time studying academic research papers on philosophy and experimental psychology, many of which were published in his academic journal, L’Année Sociologique.</p>
                <p>Durkheim was sure that the formation of society as we understand it was based on evolution, and that the way that roles have unfolded is due to the advantages of different aspects of society. Many consider him to be a structural-functionalist According to Paul Gingrich, a professor at the University of Regina, “Durkheim considers the beliefs, practices, and consciousness of the collective to be coercive on individuals as actors.” He is best known for his theories on the division of labor and the ideas of mechanical and organic solidarity. Mechanical solidarity was often found in societies with generally undifferentiated labor, whereas organic solidarity was found in societies with a high division of labor.</p>
                <p>In societies with undifferentiated labor, cohesion between members of that society forms due to the similar work, lifestyles, and struggles they encounter. This is what Durkheim coined as mechanical solidarity. In general, mechanical solidarity is exhibited in smaller, more traditional societies. Often these societies are structured around familial networks.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, organic solidarity is a bond between members of a society that stems from interdependence between groups in a society. In more modern societies, there is a greater division of labor and the reliance that each group has on each other brings about harmony. Agriculture tends to be a defining characteristic of these societies. Farmers provide food for everyone, no matter the group. Other groups bring value to society as a whole through other avenues, and each of these cogs helps the machine run smoothly. It is the differences between the groups as well as their necessity that leads to organic solidarity.</p>
                <p>Émile Durkheim left behind a massive legacy. Regularly referred to as the father of sociology, it is because of him that sociology became a scholarly discipline. He left not only mounds of research, but also a wave of academics intent on learning more about social groups and people. He may have passed in 1917, but his legacy lives on.</p>
