                <h2 id="Durkheim">Émile Durkheim, the Father of Sociology</h2>
                <p>Émile Durkheim was born April 15, 1858, in Épinal, France. He was disciplined and intelligent, graduating from the Lycée Louis le Grand and studying at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, France. Initially studying science and social science, he found a love of philosophy and centered his attention there. He became a teacher and then a professor and taught psychology throughout France. He spent much of his time studying academic research papers on philosophy and experimental psychology, many of which were published in his academic journal, L’Année Sociologique.</p>
                <p>Durkheim was sure that the formation of society as we understand it was based on evolution, and that the way that roles have unfolded is due to the advantages of different aspects of society. Many consider him to be a structural-functionalist According to Paul Gingrich, a professor at the University of Regina, “Durkheim considers the beliefs, practices, and consciousness of the collective to be coercive on individuals as actors.” He is best known for his theories on the division of labor and the ideas of mechanical and organic solidarity. Mechanical solidarity was often found in societies with generally undifferentiated labor, whereas organic solidarity was found in societies with a high division of labor.</p>
                <p>In societies with undifferentiated labor, cohesion between members of that society forms due to the similar work, lifestyles, and struggles they encounter. This is what Durkheim coined as mechanical solidarity. In general, mechanical solidarity is exhibited in smaller, more traditional societies. Often these societies are structured around familial networks.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, organic solidarity is a bond between members of a society that stems from interdependence between groups in a society. In more modern societies, there is a greater division of labor and the reliance that each group has on each other brings about harmony. Agriculture tends to be a defining characteristic of these societies. Farmers provide food for everyone, no matter the group. Other groups bring value to society as a whole through other avenues, and each of these cogs helps the machine run smoothly. It is the differences between the groups as well as their necessity that leads to organic solidarity.</p>
                <p>Émile Durkheim left behind a massive legacy. Regularly referred to as the father of sociology, it is because of him that sociology became a scholarly discipline. He left not only mounds of research, but also a wave of academics intent on learning more about social groups and people. He may have passed in 1917, but his legacy lives on.</p>

                <h2 id="Spencer">Herbert Spencer</h2>
                <p>Herbert Spencer was the first child in the Spencer family, born April 27, 1820, in Derby, England. His parents would go on to have eight more children, but none of them survived infancy. This tragic situation foreshadows a large part of Herbert Spencer’s life. He struggled at a young age dealing with establishment and authority, partially due to his family’s beliefs and partially due to the trauma incurred by losing eight siblings. He studied civil engineering and planned to work on railways but turned away from engineering in early adulthood. He found that journalism, politics, and philosophy were his calling.</p>
                <p>His first major break was as a writer and editor for The Economist, and that position helped introduce him to many popular politicians of the time. He met many people whose morals and ideals contradicted his own, but he we supremely stubborn and unwavering in his views. He viewed the world of sociology through the lens of a scientist. He believed that evolution provided clear facts that shaped how humans changed over time and believed that it not only affected physical changes but also changes in society itself. His evolutionary theory, according to the Director of the Centre of Philosophy of St. Francis Xavier University William Sweet, “was on a par with that of Charles Darwin.” Spencer’s three most popular sociological prints were <i>Social Statics, or the Conditions Essential to Human Happiness</i> (1851), <i>The Principles of Psychology</i> (1855), and his 9-volume project <i>System of Synthetic Philosophy</i> (1862- 93).</p>
                <p>Spencer’s evolutionary theory utilized Darwin’s theories of evolution. He understood that survival of the fittest was an important idea and that the organisms that would survive and reproduce would be those who were best able to adapt to the changing conditions of the world. He found two guiding principles for all social evolution: the transition from simple to complex, and the change from a militant society to an industrial one.</p>
                <p>He described two types of simple and two types of complex societies. He defined a simple society as “one which forms a single working whole un-subjected to any other and of which the parts co-operate with or without a regulating center for certain public ends.” They tended to be nomadic tribes, often with familial and kinship ties, that all worked together in similar ways to survive. These simple societies include the new Caledonians and the tribes of Guiana. Compound societies, the second form of simple societies, formed from a merger between two simple societies. Their societies were often based on agriculture and were no longer nomadic. There tended to be four to five social strata and a religious group present. Divisions of labor and politics began to appear. The Homeric Greeks were one such group.</p>
                <p>Spencer’s complex societies were either doubly compound societies or trebly compound societies. Doubly compound societies utilized a caste system, had a defined political structure, a religious hierarchy, and a moderately complex division of labor. Laws were generally formed based on societal consensus and religious decrees and often had serious punishments for transgressions. Areas like sciences and the arts had explosions in progress. These were not quite modern societies but were reminiscent of the world today. Trebly compound societies include the modern societies we generally think of. The United States, Great Britain, France, Japan, Italy, Russia, and the 1st world countries are considered trebly compound. Though Spencer does not outline the exact details of a trebly compound society, he alludes to their massive size, complexity, and division of labor.</p>
